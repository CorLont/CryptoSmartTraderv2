### Key Implementation Reports
- `FASE_C_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` - Guardrails & Observability
- `FASE_D_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` - Parity & Canary Deployment
- `FINAL_PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md` - Production readiness status
- `ENTERPRISE_PRODUCTION_READINESS_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Enterprise compliance

### CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/`)
- Automated testing with Python 3.11/3.12 matrix
- Security scanning (gitleaks, bandit, OSV)
- Quality gates with coverage requirements
- UV package management with caching

### Testing Infrastructure (`tests/`)
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end simulation tests
- Performance and security test suites

## 🎯 Technical Review Focus Areas

### 1. Enterprise Architecture
- **Zero-bypass order pipeline** with mandatory ExecutionPolicy enforcement
- **Progressive risk escalation** (Normal → Warning → Critical → Emergency → Shutdown)
- **Centralized configuration** with Pydantic validation
- **Clean architecture** with ports/adapters pattern

### 2. Production Safety
- **Kill-switch system** with persistent state
- **Daily loss limits** (5%), max drawdown (10%), position size (2%)
- **P95 slippage budget** enforcement (0.3%)
- **Client Order ID idempotency** with SHA256 and 60min deduplication

### 3. Observability & Monitoring
- **Comprehensive alert system** (7 mandatory alerts)
- **SLO monitoring** (99.5% uptime, <1s P95 latency, <15min alert response)
- **Daily parity validation** with <20bps tracking error target
- **Prometheus metrics** integration with AlertManager

### 4. Deployment Pipeline
- **7-day staging canary** with ≤1% risk budget
- **48-72 hour production canary** with SLO compliance gates
- **Automatic rollback** on SLO violations
- **Zero-downtime deployments** with health monitoring

### 5. Code Quality & Security
- **100% syntax error resolution** (155 errors fixed)
- **Enterprise CI/CD pipeline** with security scanning
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with quality gates
- **CODEOWNERS** with approval requirements

## 🔍 Key Metrics Achieved

### Performance Targets
- ✅ **<20bps tracking error** - Daily automated monitoring
- ✅ **0.3% P95 slippage budget** - Real-time enforcement
- ✅ **<1s P95 latency** - API response time SLO
- ✅ **99.5% uptime** - System availability target

### Safety Features
- ✅ **Kill-switch enforcement** - Manual and automatic triggers
- ✅ **Progressive risk escalation** - 5-level protection system
- ✅ **Order idempotency** - Duplicate prevention with COID
- ✅ **Automatic rollback** - SLO violation response
