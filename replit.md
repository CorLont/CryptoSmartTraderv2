## Overview
CryptoSmartTrader V2 is a sophisticated multi-agent cryptocurrency trading intelligence system designed for professional institutional-grade analysis. It analyzes over 1457+ cryptocurrencies using a coordinated ensemble of specialized AI agents, providing real-time market analysis, deep learning-powered price predictions, sentiment analysis, technical analysis, backtesting, and automated trade execution with comprehensive risk management. The system aims for high returns by combining technical indicators, sentiment analysis, whale detection, and ML predictions, focusing on comprehensive analysis for detecting fast-growing cryptocurrencies.

The enterprise architecture goals include higher prediction accuracy, zero dummy-data tolerance, strict confidence gating, robust async scraping, modern ML/AI techniques (uncertainty, regime, ensembles), and daily evaluation with GO/NOGO decisions. Key capabilities include zero synthetic data tolerance, mandatory deep learning, cross-coin feature fusion, true async processing, enterprise security, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, dynamic coin discovery, advanced AI/ML, multi-agent cooperation, model monitoring, black swan simulation, and real-time order book data integration.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Data integrity policy: ABSOLUTE ZERO-TOLERANCE for synthetic/fallback data - Complete elimination of all non-authentic data sources in production mode. Only 100% authentic data from direct exchange APIs allowed. Production automatically blocks any violations. No fallback, no synthetic data, no interpolated values, no NaN values allowed in production. Strict data integrity enforcement with real-time validation and automatic production blocking.
Enterprise code quality: Complete enterprise-grade code audit system implemented based on critical failure mode checklist. All 11 categories audited with 7 critical fixes applied achieving 100% success rate (August 2025).

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
The system employs a Distributed Multi-Process Architecture, managing 8 isolated agent processes (Data Collector, Sentiment Analyzer, Technical Analyzer, ML Predictor, Whale Detector, Risk Manager, Portfolio Optimizer, and Health Monitor) with circuit breakers, exponential backoff, health monitoring, and automatic restart capabilities. Each agent runs in complete process isolation to eliminate single points of failure.
