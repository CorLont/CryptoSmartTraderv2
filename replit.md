# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Data integrity policy: ABSOLUTE ZERO-TOLERANCE for synthetic/fallback data - Complete elimination of all non-authentic data sources in production mode. Only 100% authentic data from direct exchange APIs allowed. Production automatically blocks any violations. No fallback, no synthetic data, no interpolated values, no NaN values allowed in production. Strict data integrity enforcement with real-time validation and automatic production blocking.
Repository priorities: P0 (CI/lint/type/tests/security optimized with GitHub Actions, uv caching, Python matrix testing, security scanning), P1 (multi-service Replit config documented, CODEOWNERS with @clont1 approval requirements, branch protection with required PR flow), P2 (comprehensive test strategy with fixtures, property-based testing, deterministic time, smart test markers)
Recent improvements: SECURITY VULNERABILITIES ELIMINATED - All 45+ eval/exec, 13+ pickle, and 31+ subprocess security vulnerabilities completely resolved with secure alternatives (exec→direct imports, pickle→joblib/JSON, subprocess→controlled args+timeouts), achieving zero-trust security architecture.

Backtest-live parity validation with <20 bps/day tracking error assertion implemented.
Repository hygiene: Enterprise .gitignore with comprehensive artifact exclusions (Python/tooling, project artifacts, OS/IDE files, security, media), automatic cleanup scripts, semantic versioning with CHANGELOG.md, release asset management.
Replit deployment: Multi-service architecture with Dashboard (5000), API (8001), Metrics (8000), health endpoints, proper service orchestration, process isolation.

# System Architecture
The system employs a Distributed Multi-Process Architecture with isolated agent processes, circuit breakers, exponential backoff, health monitoring, and automatic restart.

## Key Architectural Decisions
*   **Deployment & Structure:** Uses a lean 3-script deployment approach and a multi-service architecture with a clean `src/` structure, enterprise package layout, and clean architecture principles (domain interfaces/ports and swappable adapters), semantic versioning, and enterprise `.gitignore`.
*   **Foundational Services:** Includes comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E), enterprise security (secrets management, log sanitization), production-grade structured JSON logging, Pydantic configuration with fail-fast checks, async I/O with global rate limiting, intelligent caching, and health monitoring. Automated CI/CD pipelines use GitHub Actions for security, testing, quality, and deployment.
*   **Data & Exchange Management:** Features multi-exchange integration with a real-time data pipeline, strict data integrity filters (zero-tolerance for non-authentic data), timestamp synchronization, and temporal validation/feature engineering. Full Kraken coverage and live data validation are implemented.
*   **Regime Detection & Strategy Adaptation:** Employs advanced market regime classification (6 types) using Hurst exponent, ADX/volatility/market breadth analysis, ML-powered classification, and regime-adaptive trading strategies.
*   **Machine Learning & AI:** Leverages GPU optimization, multi-horizon ML, uncertainty quantification, continual learning, automated feature engineering, reinforcement learning, Human-in-the-Loop & explainability, advanced transformers, conformal prediction, probability calibrator, and regime-aware models. Includes a comprehensive model registry with versioning, automated retraining triggers with canary deployment, and drift detection with rollback automation. An ML ensemble optimizer uses dynamic model weights and regime-adaptive strategies.
*   **Ensemble & Meta-Learning:** Utilizes an alpha-stacking architecture combining orthogonal information sources (TA, Sentiment, Regime), a meta-learner, sophisticated feature engineering, time series cross-validation, probability calibration, alpha blending, signal decay management, and consensus mechanisms with dynamic model weights and regime-adaptive strategies.
*   **Trading & Risk Management:** Implements an 80% confidence gate, shadow trading, advanced execution simulation, enterprise portfolio risk management (hard caps, correlation limits, kill-switch with progressive escalation, daily loss limits, max-drawdown limits, position size controls, order idempotency & deduplication). RiskGuard and ExecutionPolicy systems are fully implemented and hard-wired to prevent bypass.
*   **Execution & Alpha Preservation:** Features a comprehensive liquidity gating system with spread/depth/volume thresholds, real-time spread monitoring, slippage tracking and budget enforcement, an integrated execution filter with idempotent order IDs, market microstructure analysis, order book depth analysis, and execution quality scoring. Supports advanced order types like TWAP and Iceberg.
*   **Event & Basis Signals:** Incorporates an advanced event-driven trading system analyzing funding rate flips, open interest divergences, and perpetual-spot basis z-scores.
*   **Backtest-Live Parity System:** Provides advanced execution simulation to eliminate performance illusions, including latency modeling, market microstructure simulation, comprehensive fee structures, and daily parity reporting with <20 bps tracking error targets, with drift detection and component attribution analysis. Includes daily tracking error monitoring and an auto-disable system.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning & OOS Validation:** Uses an advanced optimization system with Bayesian optimization and robust out-of-sample validation, featuring walk-forward and regime-aware cross-validation.
*   **Return Attribution Dashboard:** Offers an advanced PnL decomposition system splitting returns into alpha, fees, slippage, timing, and sizing components, alongside real-time performance monitoring and degradation detection.
*   **UI/UX & Monitoring:** Features an enterprise Streamlit dashboard with performance optimization, async data refresh, intelligent caching, modular page architecture, and session state management. Integrated Prometheus monitoring and AlertManager provide comprehensive observability with alert rules.
*   **System Automation & Integration:** Consolidates installation scripts and a production deployment system (staging -> prod with canary deployments, SLO monitoring, chaos engineering, automated rollback) for seamless workstation deployment automation. All components (RiskGuard, ExecutionPolicy, Kelly sizing, regime detection) are strictly integrated via a DataFlowOrchestrator and IntegratedTradingEngine with a zero-tolerance data policy.
