## ADR-001: Multi-Agent Architecture

**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Makers:** Development Team  
**Consulted:** System Architects, Trading Experts  
**Informed:** Stakeholders, Operations Team

### Context

We need a scalable, maintainable cryptocurrency analysis system capable of handling multiple analysis types (sentiment, technical, ML predictions) while ensuring fault tolerance and independent scaling.

### Problem Statement

Single-threaded or monolithic approaches would create:
- Single points of failure
- Difficulty in scaling individual components
- Complex debugging when issues span multiple analysis types
- Poor resource utilization

### Decision

Implement a **distributed multi-agent architecture** with 8 specialized agents:
1. **Data Collector Agent** - Market data acquisition
2. **Sentiment Agent** - News and social media analysis
3. **Technical Agent** - Technical indicator calculations
4. **ML Predictor Agent** - Machine learning price predictions
5. **Whale Detector Agent** - Large transaction monitoring
6. **Risk Manager Agent** - Risk assessment and position sizing
7. **Portfolio Optimizer Agent** - Portfolio allocation optimization
8. **Health Monitor Agent** - System health and performance monitoring

### Rationale

**Advantages:**
- **Process Isolation:** Each agent runs in separate process, preventing cascade failures
- **Independent Scaling:** Agents can be scaled based on individual resource needs
- **Clear Responsibility:** Each agent has single, well-defined purpose
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple agents can work simultaneously
- **Fault Tolerance:** Agent failure doesn't bring down entire system
- **Development Efficiency:** Teams can work on different agents independently

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Monolithic Architecture:** Rejected due to scalability and maintenance issues
2. **Microservices:** Too much overhead for current scale
3. **Thread-based Parallelism:** Rejected due to GIL limitations and complexity

### Implementation Details

```python
# Agent orchestration pattern
class DistributedOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            'data_collector': DataCollectorAgent(),
            'sentiment': SentimentAgent(),
            'technical': TechnicalAgent(),
            'ml_predictor': MLPredictorAgent(),
            'whale_detector': WhaleDetectorAgent(),
            'risk_manager': RiskManagerAgent(),
            'portfolio_optimizer': PortfolioOptimizerAgent(),
            'health_monitor': HealthMonitorAgent()
        }
    
    def coordinate_analysis(self, symbol: str) -> AnalysisResult:
        # Parallel agent execution with coordination
        pass
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Easy to debug individual components
- Modular development and testing
- Performance optimization per agent
- Clear observability and monitoring

**Negative:**
- Increased system complexity
- Inter-process communication overhead
- More sophisticated deployment requirements
- Complex state management across agents

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement comprehensive health monitoring
- Use circuit breakers for inter-agent communication
- Standardize agent interfaces and protocols
- Create detailed operational runbooks

### Metrics for Success

- **System Uptime:** >99.5% overall availability
- **Agent Independence:** Single agent failure impacts <20% of functionality
- **Performance:** Sub-5-second analysis completion for standard requests
- **Scalability:** Ability to handle 10x current load by scaling individual agents

### Review Date

**Next Review:** 2025-07-11 (6 months)  
**Review Criteria:** System performance, operational complexity, scaling requirements

## ADR-002: UV-based Dependency Management

**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Makers:** DevOps Team, Development Team  
**Consulted:** Replit Engineering Team  

### Context

We need fast, reliable dependency management for development and deployment, particularly optimized for Replit's environment.

### Problem Statement

Traditional Python package managers (pip, poetry) have limitations:
- Slow dependency resolution
- Inconsistent environment reproduction
- Poor performance in containerized/cloud environments
- Complex lock file management

### Decision

Adopt **UV (Ultra-fast Python package manager)** as our primary dependency manager.

### Rationale

**Technical Advantages:**
- **Speed:** 10-100x faster than pip for most operations
- **Reliability:** Better dependency resolution algorithm
- **Compatibility:** Drop-in replacement for pip with better caching
- **Replit Optimization:** Specifically optimized for cloud development environments

**Performance Benchmarks:**
```bash
# Dependency installation comparison
pip install: ~45-60 seconds
uv sync: ~5-8 seconds

# Dependency resolution  
pip: ~15-20 seconds
uv: ~1-2 seconds
```

### Implementation Details

**Primary Commands:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Add new dependency
uv add package_name

# Multi-service startup
uv sync && (uv run service1 & uv run service2 & uv run service3 & wait)
```

**Configuration:**
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
cache-dir = ".uv_cache"
index-strategy = "unsafe-first-match"
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Significantly faster development cycles
- Better dependency reproducibility
- Improved CI/CD performance
- Enhanced Replit compatibility

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for team members
- Newer tool with evolving ecosystem
- Potential compatibility issues with legacy tooling

**Migration Plan:**

## ADR-003: Multi-Service Port Strategy

**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Makers:** Infrastructure Team, Development Team  

### Context

We need a clear port allocation strategy for our multi-service architecture that works well with Replit's port forwarding and monitoring systems.

### Problem Statement

Without standardized port allocation:
- Port conflicts between services
- Difficult monitoring and health checks
- Inconsistent deployment across environments
- Poor integration with Replit's port management

### Decision

Implement **standardized port allocation**:
- **Port 5000:** Main Dashboard (Streamlit) - Primary user interface
- **Port 8001:** API Service (FastAPI) - Health endpoints and REST API
- **Port 8000:** Metrics Service (Prometheus) - System monitoring

### Rationale

**Port 5000 Selection:**
- Replit's default webview port
- Standard development server port
- Automatically forwarded for external access

**Port 8001 Selection:**
- Non-conflicting with common services
- Clear separation from main application
- Easy to remember (8000 + 1)

**Port 8000 Selection:**
- Standard Prometheus metrics port
- Industry convention for monitoring
- Clear purpose identification

### Implementation Details

```bash
# Service startup coordination
uv run streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000 &
uv run python api/health_endpoint.py --port 8001 &  
uv run python metrics/metrics_server.py --port 8000 &
wait
```

**Health Check Strategy:**
```bash
# Automated health verification
curl http://localhost:5000/_stcore/health
curl http://localhost:8001/health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear service identification
- Standardized monitoring approach
- Replit integration optimization
- Predictable deployment behavior

**Negative:**
- Potential port conflicts with other applications
- Fixed allocation reduces flexibility
- Requires coordination for local development

**Mitigation:**
- Document port usage clearly
- Implement port conflict detection
- Provide alternative port configuration for development

    def should_execute(self, signal: TradingSignal) -> bool:
        return (
            signal.confidence >= self.threshold and
            signal.regime_confirmed and
            signal.risk_acceptable
        )
```

### Implementation Details

**Multi-Layer Validation:**
1. **Model Confidence:** Prediction uncertainty quantification
2. **Regime Confirmation:** Market state validation
3. **Risk Assessment:** Position sizing and portfolio impact
