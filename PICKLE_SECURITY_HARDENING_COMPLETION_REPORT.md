- **Complete access control** - Path-based restrictions enforced
- **Full audit trail** - Every operation logged with metadata
- **Runtime enforcement** - Security violations blocked in real-time
- **Secure alternatives** - JSON/msgpack for all external data

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Auto-Activation

- Runtime pickle interception active in production environments
- Violation logging integrated with existing monitoring systems

### Configuration
```bash
# Enable comprehensive pickle security
export CRYPTOSMARTTRADER_ENV=production
export SERIALIZATION_SECRET_KEY="your-secure-key-here"
```
