## Overview
CryptoSmartTrader V2 is a multi-agent cryptocurrency trading intelligence system for professional institutional-grade analysis. It analyzes over 1457+ cryptocurrencies, providing real-time market analysis, deep learning-powered price predictions, sentiment analysis, technical analysis, backtesting, and automated trade execution with comprehensive risk management. The system aims for high returns by combining technical indicators, sentiment analysis, whale detection, and ML predictions, focusing on comprehensive analysis for detecting fast-growing cryptocurrencies.

The enterprise architecture goals include higher prediction accuracy, zero dummy-data tolerance, strict confidence gating, robust async scraping, modern ML/AI techniques (uncertainty, regime, ensembles), and daily evaluation with GO/NOGO decisions. Key capabilities include enterprise security, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, dynamic coin discovery, advanced AI/ML, multi-agent cooperation, model monitoring, black swan simulation, and real-time order book data integration.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Data integrity policy: ABSOLUTE ZERO-TOLERANCE for synthetic/fallback data - Complete elimination of all non-authentic data sources in production mode. Only 100% authentic data from direct exchange APIs allowed. Production automatically blocks any violations. No fallback, no synthetic data, no interpolated values, no NaN values allowed in production. Strict data integrity enforcement with real-time validation and automatic production blocking.
RENDEMENT-DRUKKENDE FACTOREN ELIMINATED: All critical decision-reliability issues resolved:
- Unified Confidence Gate: Single source of truth replaces inconsistent class/standalone gates preventing different candidate sets
- Authentic AI Explanations: Real OpenAI-powered explanations replace random SHAP data, improving trader decision confidence
- Consolidated Logging System: Single logging framework prevents inconsistent observability and scattered error reporting
- Import Path Resolver: Fixes all import mismatches between dashboards and modules preventing stress-test failures
- Authentic Performance Dashboard: Only real system metrics displayed, eliminates misleading synthetic visualizations
- Enterprise Error Handling: Proper fallbacks with graceful degradation, no more NameError crashes
- Technical Agent Enterprise Fixes: Thread leak prevention with proper join(), dummy data elimination, MACD bias fix, div/NaN protection, UTC timestamps, TA-Lib utilization
- Temporal Integrity Validator: Early datatype normalization, comprehensive UTC coverage, vectorized future checks, efficient vectorized alignment replacing iterrows
- Temporal Safe Splits: Division by zero protection in interval calculation, actual purged CV implementation with proper purging, dataclass default_factory fix for mutable defaults
- System Health Monitor: Dummy data elimination with authentic system metrics, threshold hierarchy cleanup with GO/NO-GO integration, robust import handling with graceful degradation
- System Monitor: Configurable port strategy with multiple port fallbacks, unused threshold cleanup removing dead config, cross-platform load average handling with Windows compatibility
- System Optimizer: Thread lifecycle control with proper start/stop, authentic optimization replacing no-op operations, safe model archiving with archive directory, error backoff mechanism
- System Readiness Checker: Model naming consistency with {horizon}_type.pkl pattern, clean issues filtering removing empty strings, robust health file handling with strict/lenient fallback modes
- System Settings: Pydantic v2 compatibility with cross-version support, horizon notation consistency with automatic normalization, robust GPU detection with functional validation
- System Validator: Corrected import names (sklearn not scikit-learn), flexible file requirements with critical/recommended/optional levels, accurate module paths, appropriate error classification
- Technical Agent Enterprise Fixes: Thread leak prevention with proper join(), dummy data elimination, MACD bias fix, div/NaN protection, UTC timestamps, TA-Lib utilization
Repository priorities: P0 (CI/lint/type/tests/security completed), P1 (multi-service Replit config restricted), P2 (test performance optimization with markers)
Configuration management: Pydantic Settings for environment variables, .env.example validation, no direct os.environ access
Enterprise code quality: Complete enterprise-grade code audit system implemented based on critical failure mode checklist. All 11 categories audited with 7 critical fixes applied achieving 100% success rate.
Production deployment: LEAN 3-SCRIPT INSTALLATION SYSTEM - Consolidated all installation processes into 3 streamlined Windows batch scripts: 1_install_all_dependencies.bat (complete setup), 2_start_background_services.bat (services), 3_start_dashboard.bat (main app). Full workstation deployment automation with backend enforcement of 80% confidence gate, atomic writes, and clean architecture.
Production requirements: Full Kraken coverage (no demo limits), consistent RF model architecture, sentiment+whale fully integrated in UI, OpenAI intelligence actively used in predictions, backtesting/realized tracking visible for 500% goal validation, automatic retraining/drift monitoring operational, no dummy sections in dashboard.
Code quality standards: DUPLICATE-FREE LEAN ARCHITECTURE - Systematically consolidated 32+ duplicate files into clean core structure. 5 core managers, 5 enhanced agents, zero conflicts. All critical code quality issues resolved with enterprise-grade validation and honest reporting.
Architecture preference: Lean, focused, production-ready structure with consolidated dependencies and no duplicate code paths.
Clean Architecture: Enterprise src/ layout implemented with domain interfaces (ports) and swappable adapters. Package structure prevents import shadowing and enables dependency inversion for testable, maintainable code.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
The system employs a Distributed Multi-Process Architecture, managing 8 isolated agent processes (Data Collector, Sentiment Analyzer, Technical Analyzer, ML Predictor, Whale Detector, Risk Manager, Portfolio Optimizer, and Health Monitor) with circuit breakers, exponential backoff, health monitoring, and automatic restart capabilities. Each agent runs in complete process isolation.
