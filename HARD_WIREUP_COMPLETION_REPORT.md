## 🎯 Hard-Wired Order Flow

### Before (RISKY):
```python
# BYPASSED EXECUTION DISCIPLINE
exchange.create_order(symbol, 'limit', 'buy', amount, price)
```

### After (SECURE):
```python
# MANDATORY EXECUTION DISCIPLINE
result = exchange_manager.execute_disciplined_order(
    symbol='BTC/USD',
    side='buy', 
    size=0.1,
    order_type='limit',
    limit_price=50000.0,
    strategy_id='momentum_v1'
)
```

## 🔒 Gate System Implementation

### Mandatory Gates (ALL must pass):
1. **Idempotency Gate:** Prevents duplicate orders with same client_order_id
2. **Spread Gate:** Rejects orders when spread > 50 bps
3. **Depth Gate:** Requires minimum $10k depth on relevant side
4. **Volume Gate:** Requires minimum $100k 1-minute volume
5. **Slippage Budget Gate:** Enforces maximum slippage limits
6. **Time-in-Force Gate:** Requires POST_ONLY for maker-only execution
7. **Price Validation Gate:** Validates limit order prices vs market

### Double-Order Prevention:
```python
# First order
order1 = OrderRequest(symbol="BTC/USD", side=OrderSide.BUY, size=0.1, ...)
result1 = policy.decide(order1, market_conditions)  # APPROVED

# Duplicate order (same client_order_id)
order2 = OrderRequest(..., client_order_id=order1.client_order_id)
result2 = policy.decide(order2, market_conditions)  # REJECTED: "Duplicate order ID"
```

### Timeout/Retry Scenario:
```python
# Original order times out
order = OrderRequest(...)
result = policy.decide(order, market)  # APPROVED, but times out

# Retry with same order
retry_result = policy.decide(order, market)  # REJECTED: "Duplicate order ID"

# New order after timeout (new ID)
new_order = OrderRequest(...)  # Different timestamp -> different ID
new_result = policy.decide(new_order, market)  # APPROVED (new ID)
```

## 📊 Market Conditions Integration

### Real-Time Data Sources:
```python
market_conditions = exchange_manager.create_market_conditions("BTC/USD", "kraken")
# Returns:
MarketConditions(
    spread_bps=25.0,           # From ticker bid/ask
    bid_depth_usd=50000.0,     # Sum of top 10 bid levels
    ask_depth_usd=45000.0,     # Sum of top 10 ask levels  
    volume_1m_usd=200000.0,    # Estimated from 24h volume
    last_price=50000.0,        # Current price
    bid_price=49950.0,         # Best bid
    ask_price=50050.0,         # Best ask
    timestamp=1692027123.45    # Current timestamp
)
```

### Gate Decision Logic:
```python
result = execution_policy.decide(order_request, market_conditions)

if result.decision == ExecutionDecision.APPROVE:
    # All gates passed - execute order
    exchange_result = exchange.create_limit_order(...)
    
elif result.decision == ExecutionDecision.REJECT:
    # Gates failed - order blocked
    logger.warning(f"Order rejected: {result.reason}")
    
elif result.decision == ExecutionDecision.DEFER:
    # Temporary issue - retry later
    logger.info(f"Order deferred: {result.reason}")
```

## 🚨 Bypass Detection System

### CCXT Method Monitoring:
```python
# Any direct ccxt call is detected and logged
exchange.create_order(...)  # Triggers bypass warning:

# 🚨 EXECUTION DISCIPLINE BYPASS DETECTED!
#    Method: create_order
#    Symbol: BTC/USD
#    Side: buy
#    Amount: 0.1
#    Price: 50000.0
#    🛡️  RECOMMENDATION: Use ExchangeManager.execute_disciplined_order()
```

### Statistics Tracking:
```python
stats = get_execution_discipline_stats()
# Returns:
{
    "enforcement_enabled": True,
    "bypassed_calls": 0,
    "enforced_calls": 15,
    "bypass_ratio": 0.0
}
```
