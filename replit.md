Full workstation deployment automation with backend enforcement of 80% confidence gate, atomic writes, and clean architecture.
Production requirements: Full Kraken coverage (no demo limits), consistent RF model architecture, sentiment+whale fully integrated in UI, OpenAI intelligence actively used in predictions, backtesting/realized tracking visible for 500% goal validation, automatic retraining/drift monitoring operational, no dummy sections in dashboard.
Code quality standards: DUPLICATE-FREE LEAN ARCHITECTURE - Systematically consolidated 32+ duplicate files into clean core structure. 5 core managers, 5 enhanced agents, zero conflicts. All critical code quality issues resolved with enterprise-grade validation and honest reporting.
Architecture preference: Lean, focused, production-ready structure with consolidated dependencies and no duplicate code paths. Clean src/ layout implemented with proper package structure, eliminating import shadowing and enabling editable installation.
Clean Architecture: Enterprise src/ layout implemented with domain interfaces (ports) and swappable adapters. Package structure prevents import shadowing and enables dependency inversion for testable, maintainable code.
Documentation & Governance: Enterprise documentation structure with README_QUICK_START.md (setup + features) and README_OPERATIONS.md (incident response, health grading, kill-switch procedures). Pull request template with comprehensive checklist (tests, docs, changelog, security). CHANGELOG.md with SemVer versioning and release management procedures. Complete governance framework for code quality and operational excellence.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
The system uses a Distributed Multi-Process Architecture with isolated agent processes, featuring circuit breakers, exponential backoff, health monitoring, and automatic restart.

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Deployment & Structure:** Lean 3-script deployment, duplicate-free core, consolidated dependencies, clean archiving, and multi-service architecture for Replit.
- **Foundational Services:** Comprehensive testing (80%+ coverage), enterprise security, production-grade logging (structured JSON, Prometheus), Pydantic configuration, async I/O with global rate limiting, intelligent caching, and health monitoring with GO/NO-GO gates.
- **Data & Exchange Management:** Multi-exchange (CCXT-based), real-time data pipeline, hard data integrity filter (zero-tolerance), timestamp synchronization, and temporal validation/splits/feature engineering.
- **Regime Detection & Strategy Adaptation:** Advanced market regime classification (6 types), Hurst exponent, ADX/volatility/market breadth analysis, ML-powered classification, and regime-adaptive trading strategies.
- **Machine Learning & AI:** GPU optimization, regime detection & market regime routing, multi-horizon ML (1H, 24H, 7D, 30D, ensemble), ML uncertainty quantification (Bayesian LSTM, Monte Carlo), continual learning, automated feature engineering, reinforcement learning (PPO), Human-in-the-Loop & explainability, advanced transformers (TFT, N-BEATS), conformal prediction, probability calibrator, and regime-aware models.
- **Ensemble & Meta-Learning:** Alpha-stacking architecture combining orthogonal information sources (TA, Sentiment, Regime), meta-learner, sophisticated feature engineering, time series cross-validation, probability calibration, alpha blending, signal decay management, and consensus mechanisms.
- **Trading & Risk Management:** Strict 80% confidence gate, shadow trading, advanced execution simulation, enterprise portfolio risk management (hard caps, correlation limits, kill-switch), multi-horizon batch inference/signal quality validation, system health monitor, advanced portfolio optimization (Kelly-lite, uncertainty-aware), order book imbalance detection, and uncertainty-aware sizing.
- **Confidence-Weighted Position Sizing:** Fractional Kelly criterion with probability calibration, ML overconfidence correction, and risk-controlled sizing with regime adjustments.
- **Execution & Alpha Preservation:** Comprehensive liquidity gating system with spread/depth/volume thresholds, real-time spread monitoring, slippage tracking, integrated execution filter, market microstructure analysis, order book depth analysis, and execution quality scoring.
- **Execution Quality Management:** Advanced execution policy per pair/regime with adaptive strategies (post-only, TWAP, iceberg, adaptive), fee optimization, sophisticated TWAP executor, intelligent partial fill handling, price improvement ladders, comprehensive execution analytics, funding period avoidance, and alpha preservation tracking.
- **Event & Basis Signals:** Advanced event-driven trading system analyzing funding rate flips, open interest divergences, and perpetual-spot basis z-scores for trendomslag prediction.
- **Drawdown-Adaptive Risk Management:** Comprehensive risk management system with progressive risk reduction protocols. Drawdown monitor implements 5-level classification (Normal/Caution/Warning/Danger/Critical) with automatic Kelly/volume halving, paper-only mode, and full-stop escalation. Kill switch system provides emergency halt capabilities with multi-trigger monitoring (portfolio DD, correlation spikes, volatility shocks, data quality degradation, system errors). Data health monitor ensures real-time quality gating with completeness/staleness tracking and automatic trading blocks for poor data. Adaptive risk manager coordinates dynamic mode switching (Normal→Conservative→Defensive→Emergency→Shutdown) with comprehensive position size scaling, exposure limits, and correlation constraints. Daily loss limits (5%) provide automatic protection with shallower equity troughs and faster recovery protocols.
- **Backtest-Live Parity System:** Advanced execution simulation eliminating performance illusions between backtest and live trading. Execution simulator implements realistic order execution with latency modeling (network delays, queue processing), market microstructure simulation (order book depth, liquidity constraints, market impact), and comprehensive fee structures (maker/taker rates, volume tiers). Slippage analyzer provides component-wise attribution across 10+ sources (market impact, spread cost, timing delay, partial fills, volatility spikes, liquidity shortage) with alpha preservation quantification and benchmark comparison. Live-backtest comparator performs statistical significance testing on performance gaps (returns, slippage, fill rates, execution timing) with parity scoring and actionable improvement recommendations for continuous backtest calibration using live execution data.
- **UI/UX & Monitoring:** Enterprise Streamlit dashboard with performance optimization, async data refresh, intelligent caching, modular page architecture, and session state management.
