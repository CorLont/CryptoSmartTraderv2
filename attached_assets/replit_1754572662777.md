## System Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
The system employs a multi-agent coordination architecture with five specialized AI agents operating in parallel:
- **Sentiment Analysis Agent:** Processes social media and news sentiment.
- **Technical Analysis Agent:** Calculates over 50 technical indicators.
- **AI Price Predictor Agent:** Utilizes ensemble machine learning models for price forecasting across multiple horizons (1h to 30d).
- **Backtester Evaluator Agent:** Validates trading strategies against historical data.
- **Trade Executor Agent:** Generates trading signals and manages risk.

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python with FastAPI/Streamlit for web interfaces.
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow ensemble models.
- **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy (with vectorized calculations), CuPy for GPU acceleration.
- **Exchange Integration:** CCXT library for multi-exchange connectivity.
- **Visualization:** Plotly, matplotlib for interactive charts.
- **Storage:** Local file system with JSON/CSV exports.
