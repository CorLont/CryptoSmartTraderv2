3. **Basis Anomaly**: Spot-futures basis z-score >2 → convergence trades
4. **Crowding Reversal**: Multi-factor crowding score >70% → squeeze opportunities

**Expected Impact:**
- **Early detection** of leverage-driven price moves (4-48h lead time)
- **Contrarian alpha** from squeeze and crowding reversal trades
- **Risk mitigation** by avoiding overcrowded positions
- **Enhanced timing** through futures market microstructure analysis

**Key Components:**
- **L2 Depth Analysis**: 10-level order book imbalance calculation
- **Spoof Detection**: Large order persistence tracking and cancel rate analysis
- **Liquidity Scoring**: Tightness, depth, and distribution quality metrics
- **Real-time Monitoring**: 5-second update intervals with signal generation
- **Multi-Signal Types**: Bid/ask imbalance, spoof alerts, liquidity gaps

**Analysis Features:**
- **Volume-Weighted Imbalance**: Adjusted for order size distribution
- **Depth-Weighted Imbalance**: Distance-decayed weighting from mid-price
- **Spoofing Patterns**: 80%+ cancel rate detection for large orders
- **Expected Move Estimation**: 5-50 bps price impact predictions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Liquidity-adjusted signal reliability

**Expected Impact:**
- **Improved entry timing** through imbalance-based signals (5-15 min edge)
- **Fake order avoidance** via spoofing detection algorithms  
- **Better execution** by avoiding low-liquidity periods
- **Reduced slippage** through liquidity quality assessment

### **4. Event Impact Scoring (LLM-Powered News Analysis) 📰**
```
STATUS: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
MODULE: ml/event_impact_scoring.py
IMPACT: Event-driven alpha through intelligent news analysis
```

**Key Components:**
- **Multi-Source News Collection**: CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, CryptoNews integration
- **LLM Analysis Engine**: OpenAI GPT-4 powered impact assessment
- **Event Classification**: 6 types (listing, partnership, unlock, regulatory, technical, market)
- **Impact Scoring**: Direction (bull/bear/neutral) + magnitude (0-1) + confidence
- **Decay Modeling**: Exponential/linear/step decay with custom half-lives

**Analysis Framework:**
- **Impact Direction**: Bullish/bearish/neutral sentiment classification
- **Magnitude Assessment**: 0.1 (minor) to 0.8+ (major impact) scaling
- **Half-Life Modeling**: Event-specific decay (1-168 hours)
- **Symbol Attribution**: Multi-coin impact analysis and weighting
- **Confidence Scoring**: LLM uncertainty quantification

**Event Categories & Half-Lives:**
- **Listings/Partnerships**: Bullish, 12-48h half-life
- **Token Unlocks**: Bearish, 168h+ half-life
- **Technical Issues**: Bearish, 24-72h half-life  
- **Regulatory News**: Variable, 72-168h half-life
- **Market Announcements**: Variable, 12-24h half-life

**Expected Impact:**
- **Event anticipation** through systematic news monitoring
- **Rapid response** to breaking news (minutes vs hours)
- **Quantified impact** replacing subjective news interpretation
- **Decay-adjusted positioning** optimizing hold periods
