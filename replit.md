# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Data integrity policy: ABSOLUTE ZERO-TOLERANCE for synthetic/fallback data - Complete elimination of all non-authentic data sources in production mode. Only 100% authentic data from direct exchange APIs allowed. Production automatically blocks any violations. No fallback, no synthetic data, no interpolated values, no NaN values allowed in production. Strict data integrity enforcement with real-time validation and automatic production blocking.
Repository priorities: P0 (CI/lint/type/tests/security optimized with GitHub Actions, uv caching, Python matrix testing, security scanning), P1 (multi-service Replit config documented, CODEOWNERS with @clont1 approval requirements, branch protection with required PR flow), P2 (comprehensive test strategy with fixtures, property-based testing, deterministic time, smart test markers)
Repository structure: ENTERPRISE PACKAGE LAYOUT COMPLETED - Clean src/cryptosmarttrader/ package structure, comprehensive pyproject.toml configuration, enterprise .gitignore excluding logs/, models/, runs/, exports/, *.egg-info/, and modern tooling integration (pytest, mypy, bandit, coverage) all configured in pyproject.toml. Single clear package import path with proper artifact control. DUPLICATE IMPLEMENTATIONS FULLY CONSOLIDATED - Single source of truth per user specifications: RiskGuard (src/cryptosmarttrader/risk/), ExecutionPolicy (src/cryptosmarttrader/execution/), PrometheusMetrics (src/cryptosmarttrader/observability/) with backward-compatible aliases preventing import conflicts and module drift. EXECUTION DISCIPLINE CONSOLIDATION VOLTOOID - Legacy implement_execution_discipline.py converted to lightweight alias (918→60 lines) pointing to canonical src/cryptosmarttrader/execution/execution_discipline.py, eliminating module drift risk while maintaining backward compatibility. All services operational with clean import structure. Module drift risk eliminated. MANDATORY EXECUTION GATEWAY ENFORCED (Augustus 2025) - ALL order execution paths hard-wired through single MandatoryExecutionGateway (src/cryptosmarttrader/core/mandatory_execution_gateway.py) eliminating bypass risk, ensuring 100% Risk/Execution gate compliance, complete audit trail, emergency shutdown capability, and production-ready safety enforcement. PICKLE DESERIALIZATION SECURITY HARDENING COMPLETED (Augustus 2025) - ALL 8+ pickle.load/dump vulnerabilities eliminated with comprehensive HMAC-SHA256 integrity validation framework: ML models (joblib + signatures), probability calibrators (secure joblib), EWC data (secure JSON), model registry (cryptographic validation). Enterprise-grade protection against arbitrary code execution, data tampering attacks, and supply chain vulnerabilities. Status: DESERIALIZATION-PROOF and ENTERPRISE SECURITY COMPLIANT.
CI/CD Infrastructure: FASE B CI/CD MODERNIZATION VOLLEDIG VOLTOOID - Complete modernized GitHub Actions workflow with upload/download-artifact@v4, setup-python@v5, separate quality jobs (ruff check, black --check, mypy, pytest --cov --fail-under=70), non-blocking security scans (gitleaks/pip-audit/bandit), comprehensive branch protection with required status checks for main branch, Python 3.11/3.12 matrix testing, enterprise-grade pipeline (Security→Quality→Test→Build→Success), intelligent caching, timeout controls, artifact management with 30-day retention, coverage gates enforcement, and production-ready deployment automation. All CI/CD tools operational: ruff 0.12.8, black 25.1.0, mypy 1.17.1, pytest 8.4.1, bandit 1.8.6, pip-audit 2.9.0. Development tools fully installed and validated, core module imports passing, comprehensive pyproject.toml configuration with tool settings for all quality checks.
Testing infrastructure: ENTERPRISE TEST SUITE COMPLETED - Comprehensive unit tests (sizing, risk guard, execution policy), integration tests (exchange adapters, API health, backtest parity), E2E smoke tests (service startup, health endpoints), with strict pytest.ini configuration, marker system (unit/integration/slow/api/ml/trading/security/performance), 70%+ coverage targets, and automated test runner with quality gates integration. Backtest-live parity validation with <20 bps/day tracking error assertion implemented.
Repository hygiene: Enterprise .gitignore with comprehensive artifact exclusions (Python/tooling, project artifacts, OS/IDE files, security, media), automatic cleanup scripts, semantic versioning with CHANGELOG.md, release asset management.
Replit deployment: Multi-service architecture with Dashboard (5000), API (8001), Metrics (8000), health endpoints, proper service orchestration, process isolation. UV-based startup pattern: `uv sync && (service1 & service2 & service3 & wait)` for optimal Replit compatibility. Health endpoint returns 200 OK, waitForPort=5000 configured, parallel process execution verified operational.
Container & Runtime: ENTERPRISE DOCKER CONFIGURATION COMPLETED - Multi-stage production Dockerfile with pinned python:3.11.10-slim-bookworm base image, non-root trader user (UID 1000), comprehensive health checks every 30s, Docker Compose with monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana), complete Kubernetes manifests with liveness/readiness/startup probes, Pydantic Settings fail-fast configuration, automated deployment scripts, and comprehensive observability with alert rules. All ports documented (5000/8001/8000), security hardened with capability dropping, resource limits enforced.
